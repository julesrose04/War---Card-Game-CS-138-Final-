# War---Card-Game-CS-138-Final-
For my final project in CS 138 (Programming for Data Science) I was tasked with creating a game using Python. The requirements for the game are as follows:

-A GUI
-All working components, game should not error at any point
-A homepage
-Working quit buttons
-Use MyGraphicsLibrary
-Make use of functions, actual code for game should be short, with all functions doing the work under the hood

During production, I faced challenges completing the game. I found it difficult to implement all of the rules of the game so I had to improvise.

Please read the rules page to understand how the game works, enjoy!
