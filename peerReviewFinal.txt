Dominick recommended that I go back in and document my code more and add docstrings to all of my functions.
I went back through and made sure that everything was properly documented. I also made docstrings for every function. 

He also recommended that I make a button at the end once the player wins the game, you can click play again or quit. I made sure to implement this as well.

ChatGPT acknowledgement: 
I was having issues with the play again button.
